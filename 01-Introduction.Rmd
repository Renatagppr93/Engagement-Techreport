## Engagement as a Psychological Construct

The roots of employee [aka work; e.g., @schaufeli_conceptualization_2010] engagement research likely started with theoretical expansions of forms of employee participation [see, for example, @ferris_added_1984] and job involvement [e.g., @elloy_examination_1991]. This exploration extended into broader considerations of attitudes and emotions [@staw_employee_1994] and were informed by further exploration of the dimensionality of constructs such as organizational commitment [@meyer_three-component_1991]. The 1990's saw focused development and refinement (for example, a dissertation; @leone_relation_1995 or actual semantic reference; @kahn_psychological_1990). @staw_employee_1994 investigated the  relationships between *positive emotions* and favorable work outcomes, and although they do not use the word, "engagement", their distinction between felt and expressed emotion was likely a stimulating influence upon the burgeoning interest in the engagement construct. Gallup is also widely acknowledged as an early pioneer in the measurement of the construct [see, for example, @coffman_hard_1999]. 

@kahn_psychological_1990 described engaged employees as being physically involved, cognitively vigilant, and emotionally connected. Although occasionally referred to as residing on the opposing pole to *burnout* [@maslach_early_2008], these two constructs are currently most commonly conceptualized as being distinct [@timms2012burnt; @kim_burnout_2009; @goering2017not; @schaufeli2008workaholism], although certainly not universally [@cole2012job; @taris2017burnout].  

@goering2017not explore nomological networks, concluding that these two constructs have a moderate (negative) association, but also distinct nomological networks. @schaufeli2008workaholism investigated both internal and external association indicators, concluding that engagement and burnout (as well as *workaholism*) should be considered three distinct constructs. 

Burnout can be defined as a psychological syndrome characterized by exhaustion (low energy), cynicism (low involvement), and inefficacy (low efficacy), which is experienced in response to chronic job stressors [e.g., @leiter_areas_2004; @maslach1997causes]. Alternatively, engagement refers to an individual worker’s involvement and satisfaction as well as enthusiasm for work [@harter_business-unit-level_2002]. @schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003 further specify a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Via their conceptualization, vigor is characterized by high levels of energy and mental resilience while working. Dedication refers to being strongly involved in one’s work and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work [@schaufeli_measurement_2002]. This absorption element has been noted as being influenced in conceptual specification by [@csikszentmihalyi1990flow]'s concept of "flow". 

Regarding measurement, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) is a self-report questionnaire developed by @schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003 that directly assesses the vigor, dedication, and absorption elements. 

Our conceptualization of work engagement is the mental state where employees...  

+ ...feel full with physical energy (**Vigor**)
+ ...are enthusiastic about the content of their work and the things they do (**Dedication**)
+ ...are so immersed in their work activities that time seems to fly (**Absorption**)

The process of coming to this definitional model of employee engagement is further elaborated upon in Appendix \@ref(timeline).
