# Future plans 

![](future.jpg)

Most effort is currently dedicated to the technical report. We also need feedback reports and a user manual. The feedback report(s) are the most secondarily important.

The development of the feedback report will occur in stages:

1. static .pdf
2. "static" .html (standard template but potentially interactive elements)
3. "static" `xaringan` [@R-xaringan]
4. dynamic `xaringan`
  + user-generated presenter notes
  + user-selected visuals (taken from .html report)
5. Dynamic dashboard

The intent is to lean on the `xaringan` presentation as the central marketable piece. Initial templates should be able to do client colors and fonts via chunk specification, but evolved templates should be client-driven, such that figures can be selected and annotated from the .html, generating a user-selected and annotated `xaringan` presentation that can be hosted by Eagle but accessed via password protection by the client.

Eventually Eagle could optimize interpretation via contributions of cognitive psychologists, graphic designers, etc.

## Things to do 

+ Finalize items (SIOP papers should take care of this)
+ ~~Get survey into Qualtrics for pilot testing~~
+ Work on feedback report 
+ Generate User Manual

## Research projects

![SIOP 2022](SeattleViewinblue.jpg)

Three projects are being targetted for SIOP 2022: 

1. Engagement instrument development
  + document the *a priori* bi-factor pursuit
  + pilot study with 36 items culled to 18 final 
  + "ignore" pilot conditions (e.g., not the focus of write-up)
  + four levels of feedback:
    + overall (engagement)
    + marginal (substantive)
    + marginal (attitudinal)
    + cell (substantive x attitudinal)
  + [Morgan taking the lead (6/3/21)](https://github.com/Morgan-Russell/SIOP-Engagement)
  
2. Different paths toward scale definitions  
  + modification indices vs. corrected item-total correlations
  + final arbiter = ???
  + [Casey taking the lead (6/3/21)](https://github.com/casosorio/SIOP-Engagement-Measurment-Invariance)


3. Measurement invariance across the 4 pilot administration conditions
  + focus on 4 pilot conditions
  + look into item ordering literature (probably from 1970's)
  + relative strength of association (item-trait) based on item ordering
  + if we do this only with final scale definitions won't the conditions be watered-down?
  + currently leaderless
  
4. Engagement instrument validation (data collection summer 2021)
  + Need to first finalize scale definitions
