\section{Engagement as a Psychological Construct}\label{engagement-as-a-psychological-construct}}

The roots of employee \citep[aka work; e.g.,][]{schaufeli_conceptualization_2010} engagement research likely started with theoretical expansions of forms of employee participation \citep[see, for example,][]{ferris_added_1984} and job involvement \citep[e.g.,][]{elloy_examination_1991}. This exploration extended into broader considerations of attitudes and emotions \citep{staw_employee_1994} and were informed by further exploration of the dimensionality of constructs such as organizational commitment \citep{meyer_three-component_1991}. The 1990's saw focused development and refinement (for example, a dissertation; \citet{leone_relation_1995} or actual semantic reference; \citet{kahn_psychological_1990}). \citet{staw_employee_1994} investigated the relationships between \emph{positive emotions} and favorable work outcomes, and although they do not use the word, ``engagement'', their distinction between felt and expressed emotion likely held influence upon the burgeoning interest in the engagement construct.

\citet{kahn_psychological_1990} described engaged employees as being physically involved, cognitively vigilant, and emotionally connected. Although occasionally referred to as residing on the opposing pole to \emph{burnout} \citep{maslach_early_2008}, these two constructs are currently most commonly conceptualized as being distinct \citep{timms2012burnt, kim_burnout_2009, goering2017not, schaufeli2008workaholism}, although certainly not universally \citep{cole2012job, taris2017burnout}. \citet{goering2017not} explore nomological networks, concluding that these two constructs have a moderate (negative) association, but also distinct nomological networks. \citet{schaufeli2008workaholism} investigated both internal and external association indicators, concluding that engagement and burnout (as well as \emph{workaholism}) should be considered three distinct constructs.

Burnout can be defined as a psychological syndrome characterized by exhaustion (low energy), cynicism (low involvement), and inefficacy (low efficacy), which is experienced in response to chronic job stressors \citep[e.g.,][]{leiter_areas_2004, maslach1997causes}. Alternatively, engagement refers to an individual worker's involvement and satisfaction as well as enthusiasm for work \citep{harter_business-unit-level_2002}. \citet{schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003} further specify a ``positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption'' (p.~74). Via their conceptualization, vigor is described as high levels of energy and mental resilience while working. Dedication refers to being strongly involved in one's work and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work \citep{schaufeli_measurement_2002}. This absorption element has been noted as being influenced in conceptual specification by \citep{csikszentmihalyi1990flow}'s concept of ``flow''.

Regarding measurement, Gallup is widely acknowledged as an early pioneer in the measurement of the construct \citep[see, for example,][]{coffman_hard_1999}. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) is another self-report questionnaire developed by \citet{schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003} that directly assesses the vigor, dedication, and absorption elements.

\begin{quote}
we need to do some market research on the Q12: 1. what's the feedback report look like? (google images show one overall ``satsifaction'' score and/or one overall ``engagement'' score), 2. how much does it cost, 3. what are the 200 pulse items Gallup refers to? (6/7/21)
\end{quote}

Our conceptualization of work engagement is a mental state wherein employees\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \ldots feel energized (\textbf{Vigor})
\item
  \ldots are enthusiastic about the content of their work and the things they do (\textbf{Dedication})
\item
  \ldots are so immersed in their work activities that time seems compressed (\textbf{Absorption})
\end{itemize}

The process of coming to this definitional model of employee engagement is further elaborated upon in Appendix \ref{timeline}.

\hypertarget{ABCDAV}{%
\section{Intended Structure}\label{ABCDAV}}

Within the broader process of conceptual construct specification, we decided to attempt an intentional \emph{a priori} bi-factor structure, whereby each of the substantive dimensions (Dedication, Vigor, and Absorption)\footnote{We also discovered at this point that some contagious agent has infiltrated the minds of people working on this project, such that the word, ``absorption'' confounds our spelling abilities, and roughly 50\% of the time ends up being spelled (misspelled?), ``absorbtion''\ldots{}} could further be deconstructed into the attitudinal elements of Cognition, Affect, and Behavior \citep[see, for example,][]{eagly_psychology_1993, rosenberg_cognitive_1960}. This is not standard practice within Psychological measurement and introduces complexity into scale definitions. Appendix \ref{timeline} loosely documents the line of thought behind this decision.

Through item-writing and revision, it began to dawn on us that the substantive elements may already reflect the Cognition (Vigor), Affect (Absorption), and Behavioral (Dedication) dimensions. As of August, 2020, however, we could not locate a source article that made this potential confound explicit, so we persisted through crafting items that reflected cognitive, affective, and behavioral indicators of each substantive dimension. \footnote{We did, however, find some criticisms of the tripartite model of attitudes as originally specified by \citet{rosenberg_cognitive_1960}, although there has also been a recent attempt to reintroduce and improve upon the original model \citep{kaiser_campbell_2019} as well as repurposing of the framework as a \emph{process} \citep[e.g., thoughts and feelings leading to behavior;][]{pachankis_psychological_2007}.}

The most germaine acknowledgement of this potential construct overlap seems to be made by \citet{schaufeli_measurement_2002} (pp.~74-75):

\begin{quote}
Rather than a momentary and specific state, engagement refers to a more persistent and pervasive affective cognitive state that is not focused on any particular object, event, individual, or behavior. \textbf{Vigor} is characterized by high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one's work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties. \textbf{Dedication} is characterized by a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Instead of involvement we prefer to use the term dedication. Although, involvement -- like dedication (see above) -- is usually defined in terms of psychological identification with one's work or one's job \citep{kanungo1982measurement, lawler1970relationship} , whereby the latter goes one step beyond, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In a qualitative sense, dedication refers to a particularly strong involvement that goes one step further than the usual level of identification. In a qualitative sense, dedication has a wider scope by not only referring to a particular cognitive or belief state but including the affective dimension as well. The final dimension of engagement, \textbf{absorption}, is characterized by being fully concentrated and deeply engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work.
\end{quote}

The survey is intentionally complex in terms of item and scale associations. There are three substantive engagement dimensions as well as three attitudinal dimensions, and item cross-loadings are intended to fully exhaust the 3 x 3 conditions (e.g., each item loads on one substantive and one attitudinal dimension):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Substantive & Attitudinal\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Dedication & Affective\tabularnewline
Absorption & Behavioral\tabularnewline
Vigor & Cognitive\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The feedback report uses the terms, ``feel'', ``do'', and ``think'' instead of the Psychological literature-based affect, behavior, and cognition.

\hypertarget{item-generation}{%
\section{Item generation}\label{item-generation}}

After content validation but prior to settling on 4 candidate items per 3x3 condition, there was a dearth of items within some of the Affective, Cognitive, or Behavioral item groupings. We generated additional candidates at this point and have these items \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whB4Ve4aDDl3bxx3dIlloouTDy1ScCcxrT3gK6s9DyU/edit?usp=sharing}{located here} (Montclair State University e-mail needed to access). It was from this larger list of (reduced) candidate items that the 36 pilot candidates were identified (and in some cases modified, edited, or otherwise further crafted)

\hypertarget{CValid}{%
\section{Content Validation}\label{CValid}}

7 Eagle I.O consultants were twice instructed to place each of 34 items into one of three categories: Absorption, Dedication, or Vigor, and Cognitive, Affective, or Behavioral. Instructions asked each rater to:

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: Place an ``X'' in the column that you feel is the best fit for each item (only one ``X'' per row please)
\end{quote}

The substantive scale definitions provided for ratings were:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Absorption}: Being fully immersed in one's work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks
\item
  \emph{Vigor}: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working
\item
  \emph{Dedication}: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization
\end{itemize}

The attitudinal scale definitions were:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Cognitive}: Pertaining to thoughts or general mental processes (for example what someone thinks)
\item
  \emph{Affective}: Pertaining to feelings or emotions (for example, how someone feels)
\item
  \emph{Behavioral}: Pertaining to acts or actions (for example, what someone does)
\end{itemize}

The goal was to identify item(s) that were equally and heavily implicated with one substantive and one attitudinal scale.

\chapter{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

\includegraphics{procedure.jpg}

\hypertarget{conds}{%
\section{Pilot}\label{conds}}

The pilot administrations consisted of 36 \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KYE7jq8XLhN-mfGQRMnkf5AM-_U2CJck50eISbAiwM/edit?usp=sharing}{items} that were presented in one of four administration groupings (see Appendix \ref{pilot2}): 1) within substantive dimension (attitudinally grouped {[}but randomized within blocks of 4{]}), 2) within attitudinal dimension (substantively grouped {[}but randomized within blocks of 4{]}), 3) within substantive dimension (randomly distributed by attitude), and 4) within attitudinal dimension (randomly presented by substance).\footnote{Decision was made on 10/13 to have the order of presentation \emph{randomized} within each of the broader organization blocks (for example, Condition 3: all Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Absorption items were randomly administered, then all ABC Dedication items, etc {[}although DAC was also randomized by block such that not every respondent had the same DAC ordering{]})}

The four ``experimental'' conditions therefore prioritized and reflected the 3x3 groupings \emph{or} one of the organization schemes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral \emph{or} dedication, absorption, and vigor).

We chose to control the order of item administration because of our \emph{a priori} specification of a bi-factor structure, with the expectation that item ordering would serve as a response cue, yielding stronger factor structural support based on the organization scheme.

\hypertarget{sampling-strategy-pilot}{%
\subsection{Sampling strategy (pilot)}\label{sampling-strategy-pilot}}

The pilot sampling strategy consisted of snowball (aka referral) sampling as well as questionnaire posting within social media platforms (LinkedIn and facebook). The pilot goal was to reduce the final instrument from 36 candidate items (4 per ``cell'') to 18 retained items (2 per ``cell''). We hoped to obtain about 250 total responses viable for analysis.

The launch was informed by research looking at different ``days of the week'' and their effectiveness regarding response rate. This was both \href{https://blog.hubspot.com/service/best-time-send-survey}{commercial} as well as academic \citep[e.g.,][]{anseel_response_2010}.

Eagle I.O members sent a template email asking working adults to take the survey and forward it to family and friends who also qualify as participants. Eagle I.O members were also tasked with reaching out to other students, alumni, friends, and family through the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Facebook post on MSU I/O group page
\item
  LinkedIn profiles of all Eagle I.O members
\item
  Email first and second year students directly
\item
  Email MSU alumni directly
\item
  Email I/O professors
\item
  Mentors reached out to mentees individually
\item
  Survey was posted on the \href{https://eagle-io.weebly.com/engagement-survey.html}{Eagle I.O webpage}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{pilot-analyses}{%

These are to be included in future administrations in an attempt to develop marketable norms:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Employees who work overtime vs.~those who do not
\item
  Employees who get paid for overtime vs.~those who don't receive compensation for extra hours worked\footnote{I was thinking about this because at my job I have been working 12+ hours some days yet I do not get overtime pay. Not sure if this would work for what we are doing and I know my work experiences are not universal (nor should they be) haha!}

282 people responded. We may want to further screen these 282 responses for short response durations. According to communications with Qualtrics in early December, this is the number of seconds to complete the entire survey. Currently, the ``number of people who clicked on the assessment link (330)'' versus valid \emph{n} (282) may take care of our very low duration respondents. The shortest response duration in the 330 datafile is 101 whereas the lowest in the 282 datafile is 43. All analyses were performed via \texttt{R} version R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) \citep{R-base}. Demographic consituency of the pilot sample is located in Appendix \ref{pilotdemo}.

In addition to the below interactive plot \citep[via \texttt{plotly} version 4.9.2.1;][]{R-plotly}, a full inter-item correlation matrix is located in Appendix \ref{corrs}.

\hypertarget{htmlwidget-d8ce6266807270a52c13}{}

\begin{verbatim}
## Some items ( I find it difficult to mentally disconnect from work. ) were negatively correlated with the total scale and

## To do this, run the function again with the 'check.keys=TRUE' option
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{internal-consistency-estimates}{%
\subsubsection{Internal consistency estimates}\label{internal-consistency-estimates}}

Condition 1 administered items within the substantive dimensions (with successive randomized blocks of Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral items). Condition 2 administered items within the attitudinal dimensions (with successive randomized blocks of Absorption, Vigor, and Dedication items). Condition 3 stressed the substantive dimensions (with items fully randomized regardless of attitudinal association). Condition 4 stressed the attitudinal dimensions (with items fully randomized within attitudinal dimension regardless of substantive scale association, see Chapter \ref{conds} and Appendix \ref{pilot2}). All internal consistency estimates were generated via \texttt{psych} version 2.0.12 \citep{R-psych}. Alphas for the candidate 12-item scales were:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llllll@{}}

``Cell'' level alphas (4 items each scale, responses collapsed across administrative conditions) were:

Bifactor analysis are most commonly applied in the exploration of common method variance \citep[see, for example,][]{reise_rediscovery_2012, rodriguez_evaluating_2016}. Most commonly attributed to \citet{holzinger1937bi}, \citet{giordano_exploratory_2020} provide an overview regarding past and potential applications of \emph{exploratory} bifactor analysis and cite \citet{reise_rediscovery_2012} as an influential impetus for the resurgence of bifactor models in general. \citet{giordano2020recovering} has a recent review of seven different bifactor model applications.

Deese guys also do bifactor stuff: \citet{mansolf_when_2017}

\hypertarget{scale-reduction}{%
\section{Scale Reduction}\label{scale-reduction}}

Final scale definitions were primarily informed by two sets of indices: 1) corrected item-total correlations, and 2) CFA modification indices. We approached these two procedures as competing item-reduction techniques rather than complementary indices - we did this with the forethought of presenting the competing finalized models within a research context (for example, SIOP). The initially computed corrected item-total correlations can be found in Appendix \ref{rdrops}. The CFA modification indices extracted from the initial 36-item scale definitions are located in Appendix \ref{mods}.

The two approaches were applied in the interest of a research question. From a more practical sense, the final scale definitions were informed by these two approaches as well as a consideration of item content (was the indicator an important inclusion for proper content domain sampling?).

\hypertarget{omega}{%

Omega reliability (\(\omega\)) estimates independent latent construct reliability absent the effect of other constructs. \citet{rodriguez_evaluating_2016} identify ``Omega Hierarchical'' (\(\omega_H\)) as particularly applicable for bifactor models. Specifically, \(\omega_H\) ``\ldots estimates the proportion of variance in total scores that can be attributed to a single general factor, thereby, treating variability in scores due to group factors as measurement error'' (p.~150).

Most effort is currently dedicated to the technical report. We also need feedback reports and a user manual. The feedback report(s) are the most secondarily important.

The development of the feedback report will occur in stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  static .pdf
\item
  ``static'' .html (standard template but potentially interactive elements)
\item
  ``static'' \texttt{xaringan} \citep{R-xaringan}
\item
  dynamic \texttt{xaringan}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  user-generated presenter notes
\item
  user-selected visuals (taken from .html report)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Dynamic dashboard
\end{enumerate}

The intent is to lean on the \texttt{xaringan} presentation as the central marketable piece. Initial templates should be able to do client colors and fonts via chunk specification, but evolved templates should be client-driven, such that figures can be selected and annotated from the .html, generating a user-selected and annotated \texttt{xaringan} presentation that can be hosted by Eagle but accessed via password protection by the client.

Eventually Eagle could optimize interpretation via contributions of cognitive psychologists, graphic designers, etc.

\section{Spring 2019}\label{spring-2019}}

This is believed to be Eagle I.O's initial definition of engagement:

\begin{quote}
A state of personal immersion in work characterized by enthusiasm, dedication, and personal investment, expressed cognitively, affectively, and behaviorally in the proactive pursuit of advancing organizational goals.
\end{quote}

This definition was created by Eagle I.O Spring 2019, and modified by Kulas and Renata the following Fall semester of 2019 to include the \emph{four} dimensions of Fulfillment, Absorbtion, Dedication, and Vigor.

\hypertarget{spring-2020}{%
\section{Spring 2020}\label{spring-2020}}

We considered removing fulfillment.

\emph{Fulfillment}: finding meaning in one's work, while having a sense of autonomy, growth, usefulness, achievement, and feeling appreciated by org. {[}Satisfaction(?){]}

It was decided to operationalize fullfillment as an \emph{outcome} of engagement rather than a definitional element

\hypertarget{february-4-2020}{%
\subsection{February 4, 2020}\label{february-4-2020}}

We lost the document where we had saved the citations for the creation of our engagement dimensions. we found it today (02/04/2020).

Three out of the four dimensions (Dedication, Vigor, and Absorbtion) came from \citet{schaufeli_measurement_2002}, and we are trying to find where Fulfillment came from. We are also trying to improve the definition of each domain by looking at the current items and conducting a Modified Q sort (not correct name) to create piles of items that have commonalities within each domain.

\hypertarget{february-24-2020}{%
\subsection{February 24, 2020}\label{february-24-2020}}

Definitional amendment notes and considerations:

\emph{Absorption}: being fully concentrated and happily immersed in ones work \citep[time passes quickly and has difficulty detaching from ones work;][]{schaufeli_measurement_2002}

\emph{Dedication/Commitment}: being strongly involved in one's work and experiencing a sense of enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. \citep{schaufeli_measurement_2002} Identifying as an organizational member/ambassador

This includes conceptual elements of identification with the organization, a sense of ``oneness'', seeking continuous learning and improvement. We got rid of ``challenge'' altogether and moved the ``inspiration'' and ``pride'' elements to other categories.

\emph{Dedication}: seeking continous imporvement and demonstrating initiative

\emph{Vigor}: investing consistent effort, persistence, energy, and mental resilience while working \citep{schaufeli_measurement_2002} maybe add enthusiasm here as well

\emph{Vigor}: Experiencing persistent levels of energy and enthusiasm while working

\hypertarget{structural-considerations}{%
\subsection{Structural considerations}\label{structural-considerations}}

It was considered to potentially change from a focus on affective, cognitive, and behavioral to whether their engagement stems from content/satisfaction with the organization or the people they work with. This idea was however abandoned Spring 2020.

After completing individual Q-sorts (Kulas and Renata) we decided to revisit the originally specified substantive definitions and build them up a little to make the difference between them more noticeable (and we also retained the affect, behavior, cognition focus).

\hypertarget{summer-2020}{%
\section{Summer 2020}\label{summer-2020}}

Definitions as of 5/19/2020:

\emph{Absorption}: Being fully immersed in one's work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks

\emph{Vigor}: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working

\emph{Dedication}: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization

The development team ``content validation'' as well as the broader content validation to inform the pilot administration (see Chapter \ref{CValid}) retained these definitions we ordered all the items according to the ones we individually selected for each category and created an item bank with the remaining items. Together we placed the items in the bank into the agreed upon categories.

\hypertarget{pilot2}{%
\chapter{Pilot conditions}\label{pilot2}}

Our four orderings of items were randomized within dimension (Affective, Behavioral, Cognitive or Dedication, Absorption, Vigor), ``block'' (Qualtrics designation for groupings of items), and item. The elements that were randomized are identified in the following tables by randomized element (A, B, C, or D):

Item reading level information was performed via the packages \texttt{quanteda} version 2.1.2 \citep{R-quanteda} and \texttt{quanteda.textstats} version 0.94.1 \citep{R-quanteda.textstats} in R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) \citep{R-base}. Two indices were investigated: ``Flesch-Kincaid'' is the same grade level index that's currently used by Microsoft Word \citep{kincaid_derivation_1975} whereas ``Dale.Chall'' reflects \emph{N\textsubscript{wd}} \citep[``difficulty'' of words;][]{chall_dale_1995}. These indices are primarily influenced by two qualitative characteristics: \href{https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_readability.html}{\emph{N\textsubscript{wf}}}, which is the number of words matching the Dale-Chall List of 3000 ``familiar words'', and \href{https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_readability.html}{\emph{N\textsubscript{wd}}}, which is the number of ``difficult'' words not matching the Dale-Chall list of ``familiar'' words.

The average Flesch-Kincaied (e.g., reading grade) for our 36 candidate pilot items was 6.2 (\emph{sd} = 3.04). The average Dale-Chall index was 38.61 (\emph{sd} = 11.11).
