<p>282 people responded. We may want to further screen these 282 responses for short response durations. According to communications with Qualtrics in early December, this is the number of seconds to complete the entire survey. Currently, the “number of people who clicked on the assessment link (330)” versus valid <em>n</em> (282) may take care of our very low duration respondents. The shortest response duration in the 330 datafile is 101 whereas the lowest in the 282 datafile is 43. All analyses were performed via <code>R</code> version R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-R-base" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team, 2022</a>)</span>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Scale Reduction<a href="analyses-scale-definitions.html#scale-reduction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Final scale definitions were primarily informed by two sets of indices: 1) corrected item-total correlations, and 2) CFA modification indices. We approached these two procedures as competing item-reduction techniques rather than complementary indices - we did this with the forethought of presenting the competing finalized models within a research context (for example, <a href="www.siop.org">SIOP</a>). The initially computed corrected item-total correlations can be found in Appendix <a href="rdrops.html#rdrops">E</a>. The CFA modification indices extracted from the initial 36-item scale definitions are located in Appendix <a href="mods.html#mods">G</a>.</p>
<div id="corrected-item-total-informed-scale-definitions" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Corrected item-total informed scale definitions<a href="analyses-scale-definitions.html#corrected-item-total-informed-scale-definitions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<p>Scale reduction was performed from 36 to 22 items using modification indices from the two independent models. For example, if modification indices implicated residual covariances between substantive model indicators, and these indicators were furthermore potentially explained by the items both being, for example, “Affective”, then those items were retained. Similarly, if modification indices from the attitudinal model CFA implicated residual item covariances, and these items were associated via the substantive model, those two items were given preference for retention. This process became less instructive after the reduction of 14 items. The goal of the assessment was a finalized 18 (6 per dimension and 2 per dimensional “intersection”), so we prioritized empirial factor loadings (from both substantive and attitudinal models) for the final 4 item reductions. This resulted in two possible final scale definitions: one giving “priority” to the attitudinal model, and one giving “priority” to information extracted from the substantive model.</p>
